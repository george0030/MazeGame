To unlock view of the full map, type 'godmode' into the console. To return back to normal view, type 'sorry'.
The godmode will show the path to the crown/exit with dollar signs ($). It will make you invulnerable against the minotaur.

Walkthrough guide (the same as given by the 'help' command): 


Your Goal: Recover king Minos' crown from the maze. But beware the minotaur.
Once you take his crown, it will start chasing you until you manage to escape or you end up as its dinner. More specifically, you lose if you share a tile with the minotaur while it is not stunned.
You do, however have a magnesium flare which can distract the minotaur for 2 turns.
You win if you manage to escape the maze with the crown
Remember! Patience is key! You'll need to look for the right opportunity to strike!
